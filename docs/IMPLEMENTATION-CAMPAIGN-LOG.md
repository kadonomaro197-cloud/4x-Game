# OPERATION BLUEPRINT-TO-STEEL — Implementation Campaign Log

**What this is:** the running ledger for the campaign that turns the 17 HTML design tools
(`docs/DESIGN-TOOLS-INDEX.md`) into real, shipping game features — engine code, client windows, game data.
This file is the **lifeline**: any session can pick up cold by reading this + `git log --oneline -30` and
continuing from **NEXT ACTION**. Updated and pushed with every slice.

**Started:** 2026-08-13. **Branch:** `claude/operation-blueprint-to-steel-6kxkhb` (all work here; push only here).

**The Prime Directive (from the campaign brief):** the HTMLs are the spec. An HTML beats every `.md`. The
HTMLs' own honesty grades (LIVE / DATA / BUILD) are the build orders. Implement the *design*, not the web page
(re-express in C# + ImGui). Build everything the HTMLs specify and nothing beyond them.

---

## NEXT ACTION

> **Phase A recon complete → build the first slice.** Recon workflow `wf_98ffad13-d66` mapped the 5 Phase-A
> welds against real source. Start with the lowest-risk keystone: **A3 — `ShipRoleTools.ClassifyRole`** (purely
> additive engine helper + test; validates the CI loop) — unless recon flags a cheaper win. Then A2 (ground
> penetration), A1 (employment, flag-gated), A4 (order stubs), A5 (component scan). Work file-disjoint slices
> while CI runs (~30 min/run).

## HOW TO READ THE SLICE BOARD

Status: ⬜ not started · 🔨 building · ⏳CI in flight · ✅ landed (green). Each row names its owning HTML +
ladder row and, once landed, the commit sha.

## SLICE BOARD

### Phase A — the first-five welds (highest impact per line of code)

| Slice | What | Owning HTML / ladder | Status | Commit |
|-------|------|----------------------|--------|--------|
| A1 | Employment → morale producer (feed the dead morale term via `CrewReq`→`GetTotalJobs`, flag-gated) | `civicderived.html` / ENGINE-WIRING-BACKLOG TIER 2 | ⬜ | |
| A2 | Ground `Penetration` + `PerShotEnergy` carry-through in the ground assembler path | `entityassembler.html` / ENGINE-WIRING-BACKLOG TIER 1 | ⬜ | |
| A3 | `ShipRoleTools.ClassifyRole` + surface `GroundRoleComposer.ClassifyRole` (one helper, window+AI) | `forceswindow.html` / FORCES-WINDOW S2 | ⬜ | |
| A4 | Finish 4 order stubs: `RefuelAction`, `ResupplyAction`, `ServeyAnomalyAction`, `ShipLogisticsOrders` | `forceswindow.html` §10 | ⬜ | |
| A5 | order→ability component-scan table + `AbilitiesOf(entity)` (generalize `Has*Ability`) | `forceswindow.html` §4.5 | ⬜ | |

### Phase B — the Forces window (evolve `FleetWindow.cs`, keep the class name) — ladder S1→S9

| Slice | What | Owning HTML / ladder | Status | Commit |
|-------|------|----------------------|--------|--------|
| B-S1 | Battalions tab → built `AllFormationsFor`, scope `PlayerFaction` | `forceswindow.html` / FORCES-WINDOW S1 | ⬜ | |
| B-S3 | Make ship-combat-row + battalion-row reusable | FORCES-WINDOW S3 | ⬜ | |
| B-S4 | One "selected unit" selection abstraction (the load-bearing refactor) | FORCES-WINDOW S4 | ⬜ | |
| B-S5 | New **All Forces** flat roster tab (filters + kind-swapping detail panel) | FORCES-WINDOW S5 | ⬜ | |
| B-S6 | Per-individual ground-unit rows + engine `AllUnitsFor` | FORCES-WINDOW S6 | ⬜ | |
| B-S7 | Civilian-ship detail panel (promote logistics manifest/routes) | FORCES-WINDOW S7 | ⬜ | |
| B-S8 | Aggregate Health + Fuel accessors (the missing ship gauges) | FORCES-WINDOW S8 | ⬜ | |
| B-S9 | Stations + colonies as rows (live-owner cross-check) + assign-commander UI | FORCES-WINDOW S9 | ⬜ | |
| B-orders | Route the 23 button-only DATA orders + deep categorized menu | `forceswindow.html` §10 | ⬜ | |

### Phase C — the designers + assembler (12 door HTMLs + `entityassembler.html`)

| Slice | What | Owning HTML / ladder | Status | Commit |
|-------|------|----------------------|--------|--------|
| C-run-cost | TIER 2.5 run-cost vector (power/jobs/food/upkeep) | ENGINE-WIRING-BACKLOG TIER 2.5 | ⬜ | |
| C-staffing | TIER 2.6 workforce→production staffing model | ENGINE-WIRING-BACKLOG TIER 2.6 | ⬜ | |
| C-guided | Guided-weapon real warhead (item #3) | `entityassembler.html` / TIER 3 #3 | ⬜ | |
| C-sensors | Sensors band-match fix (item #4) | `sensorsderived.html` / TIER 3 #4 | ⬜ | |
| C-mobility | `GroundMobility.SpeedMultForUnit` scale-not-replace (item #5) | `propulsionderived.html` / TIER 3 #5 | ⬜ | |
| C-deadknobs | TIER 4 dead-knob adjudication (items 6–11 — most are STOP items) | ENGINE-WIRING-BACKLOG TIER 4 | ⬜ | |
| C-civic | New civic dials (Jobs / Amenity / PublicOrder / Commerce) per IO census | `civicderived.html` / 02-IO-MATRIX | ⬜ | |

### Phase D — planetary view (`planetview.html` → client planet view + engine) — ladder U1→T2

| Slice | What | Owning HTML / ladder | Status | Commit |
|-------|------|----------------------|--------|--------|
| D-units | U1→T2: select/read/move one unit via the ONE queued verb (kill direct-call bypass `PlanetViewWindow.cs:581`) | `planetview.html` / UNITS-ON-THE-MAP | ⬜ | |
| D-stockpile | Per-hex stockpile + hex-to-hex haul (resource-locality ruling) | UNITS-ON-THE-MAP | ⬜ | |
| D-planfn | Remaining PLANETARY-FUNCTIONAL-PLAN slices the HTML badges call for | PLANETARY-FUNCTIONAL-PLAN-2026-07-27 | ⬜ | |

### Phase E — resolver environment hooks (`resolversim.html` + ENVIRONMENT-CONDITIONS-DESIGN)

| Slice | What | Owning HTML / ladder | Status | Commit |
|-------|------|----------------------|--------|--------|
| E-env | `CombatConditions` read into the shared kernel (space combat stops being env-blind) | `resolversim.html` / ENVIRONMENT-CONDITIONS-DESIGN | ⬜ | |

## ADJUDICATION QUEUE (items parked for the developer — §6 STOP conditions)

*None yet.* When a slice hits a genuine ambiguity (two HTMLs contradict, a save-break with no safe pattern, a
DECISION-PENDING with no default, or an HTML number impossible without a redesign), it parks here with a
plain-English question + options + my recommendation, and I keep working every unaffected slice.

Known future parks (from the backlog, not yet reached):
- **TIER 4 items 6–8** (Console Space on ship bridge · chassis √-law slider · Fighter Construction Points) are
  marked DECISION PENDING — likely STOP items when Phase C reaches them.
- **What colony capture transfers** (ground-side ruling) — a documented STOP.

## LANDED SLICES — detail log

*(Each landed slice gets a short plain-English entry here: what it does, the files touched, the gauge added,
and the CI run that turned it green.)*

*None yet — campaign just started.*

## SESSION NOTES

- **2026-08-13, session 1 open.** Fresh start (no prior log). Design layer already merged (PR #90). All 17
  HTMLs verified present. Read the four campaign-map docs (DESIGN-TOOLS-INDEX, BUILD-BACKLOG-INDEX,
  ENGINE-WIRING-BACKLOG, DESIGNER-NORTH-STAR method) + CONVENTIONS + the full FORCES-WINDOW-DESIGN. Launched a
  6-agent recon workflow (`wf_98ffad13-d66`) mapping the 5 Phase-A welds + the HTML badges against real source.
  Created this ledger.
