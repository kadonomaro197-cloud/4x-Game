# The Component Designer — Dial Specifications (living doc)

**As of:** 2026-07-08 · the lowest-level spec: for each of the ~37 doors (`COMPONENT-DESIGNER-CATEGORIES.md`), the actual **dials** a player turns, the **derived stats** they produce, and the **dependencies** they require. Locked door-by-door; this doc is updated every time a decision is locked in.

**The governing rule:** *a dial is only real if it moves a number the simulation reads.* No cosmetic knobs. Every dial bottoms out in an emergent stat a resolver consumes, and every benefit shows a cost (the `CONVENTIONS §16` transparency rule).

## §0 — The framework (applies to every door)

### 0a. Universal dials (every component, whatever the door)
| Dial | Drives (real stat) |
|------|--------------------|
| **Mass** | consumes the chassis structural budget; drags mobility |
| **Size / mount footprint** | which chassis hardpoint it fits |
| **Materials / cost** | what it's built from (ties to the Industrial economy + build time) |
| **Durability (HTK)** | how much damage destroys *this component* — the grave rung |
| **Crew requirement** | feeds the crew term of the supply gate |
| **Tech level** | gates availability AND scales the achievable range of every other dial (`TechData`) |
| **Signature contribution** | does it emit? feeds Detection / EW |

Each door adds its *specific* dials on top of these seven.

### 0b. Emergent constraint — the NUMBERS force the build, never a rulebook
**The player is never told "you must add X."** They dial the **outcome they want**; every dial emits **physical quantities** (energy demand, mass, volume, heat, recoil, crew-load…); the assembly bookkeeps them; and physics does the forcing. There is **no authored requirement graph** — just three physical facts:

1. **Unmet demand throttles the output (soft, and visible).** A beam with no power source reads **output: 0 (no power)** — so the player naturally bolts on a generator. Under-fed, the beam auto-throttles to the power actually available. The player is steered by *the result being wrong*, not by a rule.
2. **Mass/volume is the one hard wall — and it's a physical *container*, not a rule.** Everything mounted (the beam + the generator feeding it + the capacitor buffering it) has mass. The **sum vs the chassis's structural budget** is the only hard gate, and it's just "a box can't hold more than it can hold." Nothing says "planet-cracker → Mega"; the *tonnage* of a planet-cracker says it.
3. **The dials auto-accommodate.** Mount an over-spec part on an under-spec chassis and its **effective** stats throttle down to what the chassis can feed/hold — shown live. Your Death-Star-dialed beam performs like a pop-gun on a frigate, telling you plainly: *find more chassis.*

**The Death Star, done right (numbers, not rules):**
1. Player wants a planet-cracker → dials beam **output** to max.
2. That output demands enormous **energy** → the beam does nothing until fed → player adds a **generator** big enough to feed it.
3. Beam mass and generator mass both scale with output → their combined mass is astronomical.
4. That mass **overflows** every Personnel/Vehicle/Hull chassis → the only container with the budget is **Mega**.
5. The player never set out to "use a big chassis." **The numbers put them there.**

> An authored graph *tells* you the rules. The physical budget *lets you find out.* We build the second.

**This is already how Pulsar computes things** — a component's `Mass` is derived from its design dials (the NCalc formulas), and a hull carries a tonnage/volume budget. So "the numbers force it" is *native*, not a new system to bolt on. The only engine work is (a) making under-supply **throttle** the effective stat instead of hard-failing, and (b) surfacing the live effective-vs-dialed readout so the forcing is legible.

### 0c. The supply currency scales with the chassis
The *thing* being supplied changes with scale, but the gate is the same:
- **Ship / Vehicle / Station:** watts (power), ammo (mass), crew.
- **Personnel:** carry-weight / stamina (a soldier has no reactor; a self-powered sidearm just *weighs* something).
So "requires power" means **reactor watts** on a tank and **battery/cell + carry-weight** on a trooper — same ⛓ edge, chassis-appropriate currency.

### 0d. The modellability test — the standing gate on EVERY dial
Before a dial ships, it must answer: **can the sim actually model this decision? If not, what's the prerequisite?** Three verdicts:
- ✅ **Modelled** — the resolver already reads an equivalent stat. Ship it.
- ◐ **Wire** — an adjacent system exists; it needs a small hook. Ship it *with* the hook.
- ⏳ **Needs-mechanic-first** — nothing reads it yet. **Name the prerequisite mechanic and DEFER the dial** until that's built. *Never ship a dead knob* — a dial the sim ignores is exactly the "fidelity nobody acts on" the audit warns against.

The yardstick for **weapon** dials is the aggregate combat resolver: `ShipCombatValueDB` → `WeaponProfile` (**nature × delivery × velocity × tracking × saturation × rate**) resolved through the **dodge / shield / armour matchup** (`GroundDamageMatrix`, `SoakFractionOf`, `ArmourSoak`, the `HitFraction` curve). A weapon dial is ✅ if it maps onto one of those axes. Each category will get its own yardstick (Propulsion → the Newtonian move/closing model; Sensors → the detection math; etc.).

**This test also drives the build order:** a ⏳ dial's prerequisite mechanic is a work item that must land *before* the dial. It's how the designer stays honest — every knob is wired to a consequence.

## §1 — Weapons

### 1.0 Shared weapon dials (common to all five weapon doors)
On top of the universal seven, every weapon has:
| Dial | Drives |
|------|--------|
| **Damage / output per shot** | base hit magnitude |
| **Rate of fire** | sustained DPS; feeds draw/heat |
| **Range** (optimal + falloff curve) | engagement envelope |
| **Tracking / accuracy** | hit-fraction vs evasive targets |
| **Mount / traverse** (fixed-forward ↔ turret arc) | which targets it can bear on (nose gun vs broadside) |
| **Firing modes** | secondary behaviors — incl. the **effect-bus** hooks (stun/non-lethal = *capture* effect vs *damage*) |

The five doors differ in **how the hit is delivered and what it beats** (the nature × delivery axes). Door-specific dials below.

### 1.1 Weapons ▸ ENERGY  🟡 *proposed*
*Directed energy: light, particle, plasma, ion. Everything from a lazpistol to a Death-Star beam falls out of these dials.*

**The anti-dominance rule (the whole point):** every option must **buy** its advantage with a real cost, so no setting is a free win. "A beam can't be dodged" is only balanced because a beam **pays** for it (dwell, range, power). Each dial below lists its options with *why you'd pick it* AND *the catch* — if an option has no catch, it's a bug in the design.

**A. Delivery — how the energy arrives**
| Option | Why pick it | The catch (why not always) |
|--------|-------------|----------------------------|
| **Continuous Beam** | **undodgeable** — hits any target it can track | must **dwell** (damage ramps while locked; a juking target that breaks your track resets it); **short** effective range (beam divergence/bloom); **heavy continuous** power drain while firing |
| **Pulse** | balanced — partial dodge, decent range, recovers power between pulses | master of nothing; a nimble target still juki some pulses |
| **Bolt** | **long range** + **power-efficient** (fire-recover, reactor rests) + big **per-shot alpha** (punch-through / first-strike) | **dodgeable** (travel time) — wasted on fast evasive targets |
| **Scatter / Burst** | many weak packets = **saturation floors dodge** (the energy-flak — anti-fighter/anti-missile) | **short range**, low per-hit, bounces off armor |

*So you pick Bolt over Beam when the enemy is slow (dodge is moot), or you need reach, or you're power-starved, or you want alpha. You pick Beam when hunting fast dodgers up close with power to spare.* Both are non-dominated.

**B. Focus — beam geometry**
| Option | Why | Catch |
|--------|-----|-------|
| **Lance (tight)** | max **range** + **penetration**, all energy on one point | single target; misses reward evasion |
| **Standard** | balanced | — |
| **Wide cone** | hits an **arc / multiple** targets; the wide-stun / crowd-sweep | **short** range, low per-target damage |

**C. Charge behavior**
| Option | Why | Catch |
|--------|-----|-------|
| **Instant / repeater** | fires now — **responsive**, high rate, **no capacitor needed** | low per-shot alpha |
| **Capacitor / charge** | huge **alpha** (one-shot kills, first-strike) | wind-up **telegraph** (vulnerable while charging) + ⛓ **requires a capacitor** |
| **Overload / hold** | the longer you hold, the bigger the dump | risks **burnout** (component HTK) + big signature |

**D. Nature — the energy type (the matchup; this is *what it beats*)**
| Option | Strong vs | Weak vs / catch |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Thermal (laser)** | cheap, hitscan-fast, high volume; great vs **unshielded** | **mirror/ablative armor scatters it**; blooms in atmosphere |
| **Particle** | all-rounder; partial shield bleed-through | jack of all trades |
| **Plasma** | heavy **anti-armor** damage + splash | slow (bolt = dodgeable), heavy, hot |
| **Ion / Disruptor** | **bypasses/overloads shields** | **wasted vs unshielded** (low HP damage) — a real reason not to default to it |
| **Graviton / Exotic** | ignores conventional defense | enormous **cost + tech**; overkill vs cheap targets |

**E. Penetration ↔ Splash**
| Option | Why | Catch |
|--------|-----|-------|
| **Penetrating** | punches **through armor** into one hard target | wasted on soft/swarm (over-penetrates) |
| **Splash / AoE** | clears **swarms / soft targets** | **bounces off armor** |

**F. Range profile**
| Option | Why | Catch |
|--------|-----|-------|
| **Point-blank** | massive close damage; brawler / PD | falls off fast — useless at standoff |
| **Balanced** | flexible | peak nowhere |
| **Standoff / sniper** | out-ranges the enemy (first-shot advantage) | low close-in damage; needs ◐ Fire Control to land |

**G. Frequency modulation** *(anti-adaptation)*
| Option | Why | Catch |
|--------|-----|-------|
| **Fixed** | cheapest, max output | **adaptive shields learn it** (Borg counter, H2b) |
| **Modulating** | stays ahead of adaptive defenses | costs output + mass — **wasted vs enemies that don't adapt** (most of them) |

**H. Thermal signature** *(the stealth tradeoff)*
| Option | Why | Catch |
|--------|-----|-------|
| **Hot / unbaffled** | max output/rate | **firing spikes your signature** — seen from far (Detection/EW) |
| **Baffled / cool** | ambush-friendly, low emission | lower output/rate |

**I. Cooling**
| Option | Why | Catch |
|--------|-----|-------|
| **Uncooled** | lighter, cheaper | sustained rate **throttles** under heat — a burst weapon |
| **Cooled** | sustains high rate-of-fire | heavier + ◐ requires a cooling system |

**J. Medium performance** *(where it works)*
| Option | Why | Catch |
|--------|-----|-------|
| **Vacuum-tuned** | best in space | **scatters in atmosphere / water** |
| **Atmospheric / submersible** | works in air/fog/underwater (a sub's or tank's energy gun) | lower peak range/output |

**K. Efficiency** *(damage per watt — a supply/mass decision)*
| Option | Why | Catch |
|--------|-----|-------|
| **High-efficiency** | less draw → a smaller/lighter generator → lighter build | lower peak output per shot |
| **Brute-force** | max damage | power-hungry → a bigger generator → heavier build (the mass forcing bites harder) |

**L. Linked fire** *(emitter count — alpha vs coverage)*
| Option | Why | Catch |
|--------|-----|-------|
| **Linked** | all emitters fire as one → **big combined hit** (beats flat armour) | one shot = one target; a miss wastes all of it |
| **Independent** | each emitter engages separately → **splits fire** across targets | small per-hit — bounces off armour |

**M. Point-defense capability** *(can it shoot down incoming?)*
| Option | Why | Catch |
|--------|-----|-------|
| **PD-capable** | intercepts incoming **missiles / fighters** | needs fast tracking + short range — a compromise vs its anti-ship role |
| **Anti-ship only** | full output/range vs big targets | helpless against a saturating missile swarm |

**Derived stats (computed, shown to the player):**
`power draw = output × rate ÷ efficiency` · damage/salvo · sustained DPS · dodge-fraction (delivery × tracking) · signature spike (output × thermal-bloom) · mass · cost.

**Modellability audit (the §0d gate applied — what the resolver actually reads):**
| Dial | Verdict | How the sim models it |
|------|---------|------------------------|
| Output · Rate · Tracking | ✅ | firepower / sustained-DPS / hit-fraction in `ShipCombatValueDB` |
| Delivery (beam/bolt/scatter) | ✅ | `WeaponProfile.Delivery` → the `HitFraction` dodge curve (beam ignores evasion; scatter = saturation floors it) |
| Nature (thermal/ion/…) | ✅ | shield `SoakFractionOf` + `WeaponNature` matchup (ion = exotic bypass, per `DisruptorWeaponTests`) |
| Penetration ↔ Splash | ✅ | `ArmourSoak` (flat-per-source — penetration beats it, splash bounces) |
| Focus · Linked fire | ✅ | saturation + the existing **fire-split** across targets (`MultiPartyEngagement`) |
| Range profile | ✅ | the weapon-range engagement trigger / closing model |
| Efficiency | ✅ | scales power draw → feeds the mass-forcing (§0b) |
| Thermal bloom / signature | ◐ **wire** | EMCON *already* reads `ShotsFiredThisTick` → activity (`EmconActivityProcessor`); the dial just scales that firing-heat term |
| Cooling / heat | ◐ **wire** | effective rate = f(heat, cooling); the resolver already reads rate |
| Overcharge / burnout | ◐ **wire** | a self-damage-on-overcharge rule (the damage system already removes components) |
| Point-defense | ◐ **wire** | intercept incoming ordnance (`MissileImpactProcessor` + the flak anti-missile role exist; needs the PD-targeting hook) |
| Charge (the damage profile) | ✅ | high-damage / low-effective-rate — the aggregate resolver represents this natively |
| Charge (the "vulnerable telegraph" window) | ⏳ **defer** | the salvo resolver isn't per-shot-timed; **abstract to hi-dmg/lo-rate for now**, revisit if combat goes finer-grained |
| **Frequency modulation** | ⏳ **defer** | needs **adaptive shields (H2b)** built first — with no adaptive defense there is nothing to modulate against |
| **Medium performance** | ⏳ **defer** | needs a **combat-environment modifier** (space / atmosphere / water) — space combat doesn't tag a medium yet |

**Reading of the audit:** the Energy door is **overwhelmingly modellable today** — the aggregate resolver already speaks in nature × delivery × saturation × tracking × armour/shield, which is most of these dials. Four need a small **wire** to an adjacent system that already exists. Only **three** must **wait on a prerequisite mechanic** (adaptive shields, a combat-medium modifier, and finer combat timing) — and those three become explicit build items *before* their dials ship. No dead knobs.

**Physical demands (what the dials cost — throttles and mass, never a rulebook, per §0b):**
- **Power draw** = output × rate. Not "required" — *unmet → the beam auto-throttles to available power* (a Death-Star dial on a frigate fires like a pop-gun). The player adds a generator because the readout shows the shortfall, then finds the generator's **mass** funnels the chassis size.
- **Buffered energy (capacitor)** — a Charge/Overload shot can only accumulate as much as you can store; **no capacitor = no big alpha** (the dial caps itself), not an error.
- **Heat** — sustained fire builds heat; undissipated heat **throttles rate** automatically. Add cooling (which adds mass) to sustain it.
- **Accuracy at range** — without Fire Control the standoff hit-chance is just *low* (a number); a standoff build naturally wants one.
- **Mass** — the real forcer. Output/rate/nature/cooling all add mass; that mass + the generator's + the capacitor's is the tonnage the chassis budget must physically hold. This is the only hard wall, and it's a container, not a rule.

**Preset coordinates — proof the dials span the franchises (each a distinct point in the option space):**
| Weapon | Delivery | Focus | Charge | Nature | Range | The trade it chose |
|--------|----------|-------|--------|--------|-------|--------------------|
| **Lazpistol** | Bolt | Lance | Instant | Thermal | Point-blank | cheap + light (fits Personnel), pays in range/alpha |
| **Phaser array** | Beam | Wide↔Lance | Instant | Particle | Balanced | undodgeable + stun-mode, pays in reactor draw |
| **Turbolaser** | Bolt | Lance | Instant | Plasma | Standoff | reach + anti-armor alpha, pays in dodge-ability + ⛓ big reactor |
| **Ion / disruptor** | Bolt | Standard | Instant | **Ion** | Balanced | ignores shields, **useless vs unshielded** |
| **Flak-laser (PD)** | Scatter | Wide | Instant | Thermal | Point-blank | floors fighter dodge, pays in range |
| **Death-Star beam** | Beam | Lance | **Charge** | Graviton | Standoff | plate-cracking alpha; its output demands a huge generator + capacitor, whose **mass** overflows everything below **Mega** — plus a long telegraph |

The Death Star is the payoff: you can *dial* a planet-cracker onto any chassis, but the **tonnage** of the beam + the generator that feeds it + the capacitor that buffers it won't fit anything under Mega — and on a smaller hull the effective output just throttles to a pop-gun. The design falls out of the dials; the Mega chassis falls out of the *numbers*, never a rule.

### 1.2 Weapons ▸ BALLISTIC  🟡 *proposed*
*Kinetic projectiles: rifles, autocannons, tank guns, railguns, flak, mass drivers. Same scaffold as Energy, but the physics **forces differently** — the cascade is **ammo mass** (a magazine that runs dry) instead of power draw, and the stability cost is **recoil** instead of heat. Everything from an assault rifle to a planet-bombarding mass driver falls out of these dials.*

**Anti-dominance rule applies** (every option buys its edge with a real cost). And two ballistic-only forcings you'll see throughout:
- **Ammo mass cascade** — shells have mass; magazine mass = shell-mass × capacity. A high-rate big-bore gun demands a huge magazine → huge mass → a bigger chassis (the ammo twin of Energy's generator-mass cascade). And it **runs dry** → resupply (this is *already built*: `GroundAmmo` — `MaxAmmo_kg`/`CurrentAmmo_kg`/`IsDry`/resupply).
- **Recoil forcing** — firing shoves the platform; recoil is absorbed by **chassis mass**. A battleship gun on a frigate can't be aimed (or shoves the hull) → another reason big guns funnel to big chassis, by the numbers.

**A. Projectile — what you throw (the core ballistic axis)**
| Option | Why | The catch |
|--------|-----|-----------|
| **Solid slug (kinetic)** | cheap, dense, high **penetration** by pure KE | no splash (over-penetrates soft targets); dodgeable |
| **Explosive shell (HE)** | **splash/AoE** — clears soft targets & clusters | bounces off heavy armour; heavier per round (magazine fills faster) |
| **Sabot / AP dart** | **max armour penetration** | wasted on soft/swarm; costly ammo |
| **Flak / canister (pellets)** | many pellets = **saturation floors dodge** (anti-fighter/missile) | short range, low per-hit, useless vs armour |

**B. Muzzle velocity — the accelerator (ballistic "delivery")**
| Option | Why | The catch |
|--------|-----|-----------|
| **Low (howitzer/mortar)** | lobs heavy shells, **low recoil**, cheap, can arc indirect | slow → very **dodgeable**, short direct range |
| **High (cannon)** | flatter, longer direct range, more KE | more recoil, barrel wear |
| **Hyper (railgun/gauss)** | near-hitscan → **hard to dodge**, extreme range + KE | huge recoil + **draws power to accelerate the slug** (this is what naturally makes a railgun "ammo **and** power" — the "Both" supply, emergent from the dial, no special rule) |

**C. Rate / feed**
| Option | Why | Catch |
|--------|-----|-------|
| **Single-shot** | max per-shot power, light, sips ammo | slow — misses hurt, bad vs fast targets |
| **Autocannon (rapid)** | high rate + **suppression/saturation** | **drains the magazine fast** + more recoil + wear |

**D. Caliber / shell mass**
| Option | Why | Catch |
|--------|-----|-------|
| **Small** | light ammo (more rounds per magazine-mass), high rate | weak vs armour |
| **Large** | huge per-hit, anti-armour/capital | heavy ammo (magazine fills fast), slow, big recoil |

**E. Recoil management — the stability cost (ballistic analog of cooling)**
| Option | Why | Catch |
|--------|-----|-------|
| **Unbraced** | light, cheap | recoil **wrecks accuracy on a light chassis** (penalty scales recoil ÷ chassis-mass); can shove a small unit |
| **Compensated (brake/dampers)** | stable on lighter platforms | adds mass |
| **Recoilless** | fire a big gun off a tiny frame | **bleeds muzzle energy** → less range/penetration |

**F. Fuzing (unguided — not the Guided door)**
| Option | Why | Catch |
|--------|-----|-------|
| **Contact** | full damage on a direct hit | must hit directly |
| **Proximity (airburst)** | detonates near the target → **floors evasion** without a direct hit (the flak fuze) | needs a sensor fuze (cost); less than a direct-hit's damage |
| **Delayed/penetrating** | punch in *then* detonate (bunker-buster) | needs the right depth setting; wasted on soft targets |

**G. Ammo loadout — selectable rounds**
| Option | Why | Catch |
|--------|-----|-------|
| **Single type** | full magazine of one round, simple | wrong vs off-matchup targets |
| **Multi-ammo (switchable)** | swap AP/HE/flak to match the target in-fight | splits magazine capacity; a switch costs a reload cycle |

**H. Trajectory**
| Option | Why | Catch |
|--------|-----|-------|
| **Direct-fire** | flat, precise, immediate | blocked by terrain/cover |
| **Indirect (arcing artillery)** | lobs over cover/terrain, hits from beyond line-of-sight | needs a **spotter** for accuracy; slow shells (dodgeable) |

**Physical demands (the forcing — mass + recoil, never a rulebook, per §0b):**
- **Ammo mass** = shell-mass × capacity → the magazine's mass funnels the chassis size, and the gun **runs dry** → resupply (Logistical). *Already modelled* (`GroundAmmo`).
- **Recoil** → accuracy penalty = recoil ÷ chassis-mass; big gun on a small hull = can't aim. The chassis mass is the recoil sink → big guns force big chassis.
- **Power** — *only* if velocity is dialed to hyper (railgun); the power demand appears on its own and cascades the generator mass, exactly as in Energy. This is where a railgun becomes a dual-supply weapon with no authored flag.
- **Mass** of the gun scales with caliber × velocity.

**Modellability audit (§0d — what the resolver reads):**
| Dial | Verdict | How the sim models it |
|------|---------|------------------------|
| Projectile (slug/HE/sabot/flak) | ✅ | `WeaponNature` kinetic + splash/penetration (`ArmourSoak`) + flak saturation (`FlakWeaponTests`) |
| Muzzle velocity | ✅ | velocity is a `WeaponProfile` axis → dodge-ability (`RailgunWeaponTests`: finite-velocity, dodgeable) |
| Rate · Caliber | ✅ | firepower / saturation / rate |
| **Ammo mass / runs-dry** | ✅ | **already built** — `GroundAmmo` (`MaxAmmo_kg`, `IsDry`, resupply) |
| Fuzing — proximity/airburst | ✅ | saturation-floors-dodge (the flak model) |
| Power (hyper-velocity) | ✅ | the supply model already rates railgun as ammo+power ("Both") |
| **Recoil → accuracy** | ◐ **wire** | accuracy = f(recoil ÷ chassis-mass); resolver reads accuracy, the chassis-mass term needs a hook |
| Multi-ammo switching | ◐ **wire** | swap the active `WeaponProfile` (firing-mode style); resolver reads one profile at a time |
| Recoilless (energy bleed) | ◐ **wire** | a range/penetration reduction term |
| **Indirect / arcing + spotter** | ⏳ **defer** | needs **line-of-sight/terrain blocking + a spotter relay**; ground has terrain+hexes (partial), space has no LOS block — build the LOS+spotter mechanic before this dial |

**Reading:** Ballistic is **even more ready than Energy** — the ammo half (the biggest new system a projectile weapon needs) is *already built* (`GroundAmmo`), and velocity/flak/nature all map to the resolver. Three small **wires** (recoil→accuracy, multi-ammo switch, recoilless bleed) and one **deferred** dial (indirect-fire needs LOS + a spotter mechanic first).

**Preset coordinates — the span, each a distinct point:**
| Weapon | Projectile | Velocity | Rate | The trade it chose |
|--------|-----------|----------|------|--------------------|
| **Assault rifle** | small slug | high | rapid | light, sips ammo (fits Personnel); weak vs armour |
| **Autocannon (PD)** | HE/flak | high | rapid | saturation vs fighters/missiles; short range |
| **Tank cannon** | sabot/HE | high | single | anti-armour alpha; big recoil → needs a Vehicle to brace |
| **Railgun** | slug | **hyper** | single/burst | undodgeable + reach; pays in **recoil + power** (dual-supply) |
| **Howitzer** | large HE | **low, indirect** | single | lobs over cover; ⏳ needs a spotter; slow shells |
| **Mass driver** | huge slug | hyper | single | planet bombardment; its **shell mass + recoil + power** overflow everything below a Mega chassis |

Same lesson as the Death Star, kinetic flavour: the **mass driver** confines itself to Mega because a planet-cracking slug's mass, magazine, recoil sink, and railgun power simply won't fit smaller — the numbers force it.
