# Designer Audit 03 — Component ABILITIES × HOSTS (the universality matrix)

**Scope:** Every `IComponentDesignAttribute` in the engine — the ABILITY a designed part grants — mapped to the PROCESSOR that reads it and therefore the HOST(S) on which it actually does anything. Then the crucial finding: the **parallel/duplicated abilities** — one real-world capability modelled by two different attributes for two different hosts, which is *why* the designers aren't universal.

## The one-paragraph finding

An ability is real on a host **only if some processor reads that attribute off that host's `ComponentInstancesDB`.** Two separate gates decide universality, and they are *not* the same gate:

1. **The mount flag** (`ComponentMountType`, `Engine/DataStructures/Enums.cs:125`) decides which **designer/host the UI lets you put the part on.** It's a portable `[Flags]` — in principle one part could mount ship+colony+ground.
2. **The processor reader** decides whether the ability **does anything once mounted.** This is the real lock. A processor that iterates only ship entities (or only colonies, or only ground units) makes the ability host-locked *no matter what the mount flag says.*

The generic infrastructure (`ComponentInstancesDB.TryGetComponentsByAttribute<T>`, `Engine/Components/ComponentInstancesDB.cs:46`) is genuinely host-agnostic — it just returns whatever components carry the attribute. But almost every **reader** is written inside a host-specific subsystem, so the same real capability got modelled **twice**: once as a space attribute read by a space processor, once as a ground attribute read by a ground processor. The clearest proof it *doesn't have to be this way* is `EnergyGenerationAtb` — the one attribute a **ground** system reads directly (`GroundCombat/WeaponSupply.cs:104`) *and* a **space** system reads (`Energy/EnergyGenProcessor.cs`). Reactors are universal; almost nothing else is.

---

## How an ability reaches a host (the mechanism, plain English)

Think of each attribute as a rating plate bolted to a part. Two things have to line up for the plate to matter:

- **`OnComponentInstallation(parentEntity, instance)`** (`Engine/Components/IComponentDesignAttribute.cs:15`) fires when the part is installed on ANY entity (`Engine/Entities/Entity.cs:131,168`). Some abilities wire themselves in here (e.g. a solar panel builds an `EnergyGenAbilityDB` on its host — `Energy/EnergySolarGenerationAtb.cs:48`; a sensor schedules its first scan — `Sensors/SensorRecever/SensorReceiverAtb.cs:117`). Most **ground** attributes make this a **no-op** ("inert on install") and are read on-demand instead.
- **A processor** later calls `host.ComponentInstancesDB.TryGetComponentsByAttribute<TAtb>(...)` (or `design.GetAttribute<TAtb>()`). **This is the host lock.** If no processor that iterates *this host type* ever asks for the attribute, the ability is dead weight on that host even though the mount flag allowed it.

So "the designer isn't universal" = "the ability's only reader lives in a subsystem that only iterates one kind of host."

---

## Master table — every attribute, its reader, its hosts

Hosts: **Ship** (incl. Station — stations reuse the ship/colony component framework), **Colony** (`PlanetInstallation`), **Ground** (a `GroundUnit`'s backing entity, units-as-entities Option A), **Missile** (`OrdnanceDesign`). "Read by" cites the load-bearing reader.

## PARALLEL / DUPLICATED ABILITIES — the crucial finding

Each pair is **the same real capability, modelled twice**, because the space reader iterates ships and the ground reader iterates ground units. In every case the mount flag *could* be widened; the blocker is that the ability's reader lives in a host-specific subsystem.

### 1. RADAR — `SensorReceiverAtb` (space) ↔ `GroundSensorAtb` (ground)
- **Space:** `Sensors/SensorRecever/SensorReceiverAtb.cs:10` — a full EM model (peak wavelength, bandwidth, best/worst sensitivity in kW, resolution, scan time). Read by `SensorTools.cs:216` / `SensorScan`, which iterate sensor-bearing **ships/colonies**.
- **Ground:** `GroundCombat/GroundSensorAtb.cs:21` — one stat, `Range_km`. Read by `GroundSensors.cs:69`, which iterates **ground units'** backing entities and reveals hex bands.
- **Why separate:** the space sensor speaks EM-spectrum-and-signal-quality; the ground one speaks flat kilometres translated to hexes. The two readers (`SensorScan` vs `GroundSensors.RevealFromUnits`) never touch each other. The Sensors CLAUDE.md even states the rule explicitly: *"Do not reuse `SensorScan` for ground unit spotting; it's the wrong tool."*
- **To unify:** one detection attribute with a range expressed portably, plus a reader that runs on both a space contact model and a ground hex reveal — i.e. a shared "detection" service both subsystems call, or a ground reader that consumes `SensorReceiverAtb.BestSensitivity_kW` reduced to an effective range.

### 2. WEAPONS — space weapon atbs ↔ `GroundWeaponAtb` (mid-merge)
- **Space:** `GenericBeamWeaponAtb`, `RailgunWeaponAtb`, `FlakWeaponAtb`, `DisruptorWeaponAtb`, `PlasmaBoltWeaponAtb`, `MissileLauncherAtb` — read by `Combat/ShipCombatValueDB.cs:175-263` and `GenericFiringWeaponsDB`.
- **Ground:** `GroundCombat/GroundWeaponAtb.cs:30` (Mass/Attack/Range/Mode) — read by `GroundUnitAssembly.cs:89`.
- **Status — partially unified already:** `GroundCombat/WeaponSupply.cs:41-95` classifies the **space** weapon atbs (laser→Energy, railgun→Both, flak→Ammo, etc.) for the ground power/ammo gate, so a ground unit can *carry* a space weapon and be supply-gated. So today a ground unit can mount **either** the old `GroundWeaponAtb` **or** a real space weapon — the classic duplicate-mid-refactor. `docs/combat/WEAPONS-DESIGN.md` tracks the planned P4 merge that retires `GroundWeaponAtb`.
- **To unify:** finish P4 — make the ground resolver read damage off the space weapon atbs (via a shared classifier) and delete `GroundWeaponAtb`.

### 3. SHIELDS — `ShieldAtb` (space) ↔ `GroundAugmentAtb.Shield` (ground)
- **Space:** `Combat/ShieldAtb.cs:18` — read by `ShipCombatValueDB.cs:276`.
- **Ground:** the `Shield` field on `GroundCombat/GroundAugmentAtb.cs:36` — read by `GroundUnitAssembly.cs` and applied by `GroundDamageMatrix`. The augment doc even says it *"rides the same evasion the ship dodge model uses"* — the intent to share is stated, the type is not.
- **To unify:** hoist shield (and evasion — see below) into one attribute both resolvers read.

### 4. EVASION / DODGE — ship dodge model ↔ `GroundAugmentAtb.EvasionBonus`
- Ship dodge lives in the weapons/dodge resolver (`docs/combat/WEAPONS-DESIGN.md`); ground evasion is `GroundAugmentAtb.EvasionBonus` (`GroundAugmentAtb.cs:32`), read by `GroundDamageMatrix`. Same currency by design, two code paths.

### 5. PROPULSION / MOBILITY — `NewtonionThrustAtb` + `WarpDriveAtb` (space) ↔ `GroundLocomotionAtb` + `GroundChassisAtb` (ground)
- **Space:** `Movement/NewtonMove/NewtonionThrustAtb.cs:8` (read `EntityExtensions.cs:93`) and `Movement/WarpMove/WarpDriveAtb.cs:8` (read `ComponentInstancesDBExtensions.cs:116`) turn power+fuel into velocity.
- **Ground:** `GroundCombat/GroundLocomotionAtb.cs:24` (SpeedFactor/RoughHandling/Amphibious) and the frame's `GroundChassisAtb` locomotion class — read by `GroundMobility.cs:47,58` to divide march time.
- **Why separate:** space movement is Newtonian delta-V through a physics processor; ground movement is a hex move-time multiplier. Completely different math, no shared "propulsion" abstraction.

### 6. CARRY CAPACITY — `CargoStorageAtb` (space) ↔ `GroundBayAtb` (transport)
- **Space:** `Storage/CargoStorageAtb.cs:7` — read by `StorageSpaceProcessor.cs:40`.
- **Transport:** `GroundCombat/GroundBayAtb.cs:34` — read by `GroundTransport.cs:44`. **Both mount on a ship**, yet they're two attributes for "this part holds N units of stuff." A troop/vehicle bay is a specialised cargo hold with a class filter.
- **To unify:** a bay could be a `CargoStorageAtb` with a cargo-type restricted to "ground unit," rather than a parallel attribute with its own reader.

### 7. AMMO / MAGAZINE — ordnance & `GenericWeaponAtb.InternalMagSize` (space) ↔ `GroundMagazineAtb` (ground)
- **Space:** ammo lives as `GenericWeaponAtb.InternalMagSize` (`WeaponState.cs:52`) and as stockpiled `OrdnanceDesign` cargo.
- **Ground:** `GroundCombat/GroundMagazineAtb.cs:21` — a mass-based `Capacity_kg` pool, read by `WeaponSupply.cs:66`.
- Two different "how much ammo does this hold" models.

### 8. HAZARD / ENVIRONMENT RESISTANCE — `HazardResistanceAtb` (space) ↔ ground `EnvResistance` (not even an attribute)
- **Space:** `Hazards/HazardResistanceAtb.cs:20` — a real component attribute, read by `SpaceHazardTools.cs:97`.
- **Ground:** folded into `GroundUnitDesign.EnvironmentalResistance` (a design map, snapshotted onto the `GroundUnit`), **not** modelled as an installable/strippable component at all (GroundCombat CLAUDE.md flags this: gear-as-a-real-component is the v2 promotion). So the ground side isn't just a duplicate attribute — it's a *weaker* modelling (no cradle-to-grave grave rung).

### 9. ARMOUR — ship armour (a ship-level property) ↔ `GroundArmorAtb` (a component)
- **Ship armour is not an `IComponentDesignAttribute` at all** — it's an armour layer/property on `ShipDesign`. **Ground armour IS a component** (`GroundArmorAtb.cs:18`). So the same concept is a monolithic ship property on one host and a mounted, losable component on the other — a *modelling mismatch*, the inverse of the hazard case.

### The counter-example that proves unification is possible — `EnergyGenerationAtb`
`Energy/EnergyGenerationAtb.cs:10` is read by the **space** power system (`EnergyGenProcessor.cs:13`, via `EnergyGenAbilityDB` built in `OnComponentInstallation`) **and** directly by the **ground** power gate (`GroundCombat/WeaponSupply.cs:104`). It is the single attribute that is genuinely universal across space and ground. It shows the fix pattern: a ground subsystem reading a *space* attribute rather than inventing a parallel one.

## Open questions / gaps

1. **The mount flag and the reader disagree, silently.** Nothing checks that a part whose `ComponentMountType` allows `GroundUnit` actually has a *ground reader* for its abilities (or vice-versa). A designer could legally mount a `SensorReceiverAtb` part on a ground unit and it would do **nothing** — no ground processor reads it. A universality fix needs either a validation pass (mount flag ⇒ a reader exists on that host) or the shared readers that make the flag meaningful.
2. **Ground abilities are read by an ASSEMBLER, not a live hotloop.** Most ground atbs (`GroundWeaponAtb`, `GroundArmorAtb`, `GroundAugmentAtb`, `GroundChassisAtb`) are read once by `GroundUnitAssembly` at design/build time and flattened into `GroundUnitDesign` stats — not re-read live off `ComponentInstancesDB`. The units-as-entities backing store exists but only `GroundSensorAtb`/`GroundLocomotionAtb` are read off it live. So even *within* ground, the "component on a host" contract is half-wired. (Tracked in `docs/economy/UNIVERSAL-ASSEMBLY-DESIGN.md`.)
3. **Which pairs are cheapest to unify?** Ranked by how close the two sides already are:
   - **Weapons** — nearly done; `WeaponSupply` already classifies space atbs on ground. Finish P4.
   - **Reactor** — already unified; use it as the template.
   - **Cargo vs GroundBay** — both mount on ships and both are "capacity + a type filter"; a `CargoStorageAtb` with a ground-unit cargo type could delete `GroundBayAtb`.
   - **Shield/evasion** — the augment doc already says it uses the ship currency; hoist to one attribute.
   - **Radar** — hardest: the two are genuinely different math (EM-spectrum vs km-to-hex). Needs a shared detection *service*, not just a shared attribute.
4. **Armour and hazard-resistance are modelling mismatches, not just duplicate attributes** — one host models the capability as a component, the other as a baked property/design-map. Unifying these means promoting the weaker side to a real component first (a bigger job than merging two attributes).
5. **Stations inherit ship/colony readers "for free"** because they reuse the same component framework — so stations are the accidental proof that a host with no bespoke processors still gets every ability whose reader iterates by DataBlob type rather than by host class. The lesson for universality: **readers keyed to the ABILITY's derived DataBlob (like `EnergyGenAbilityDB`) are automatically portable; readers keyed to a host blob (`ShipInfoDB`, `ColonyInfoDB`, `GroundForcesDB`) are the locks.**
